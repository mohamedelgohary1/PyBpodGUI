# PyBpodGUI

PyBpodGUI is a GUI utility to run neuroscience experiments with the _Bpod_ system by [Sanworks](https://sanworks.io/).
The GUI is written in Python using PyQt5 and connectivity to the _Bpod_ system is made possible thanks to the
[PyBpod API](https://pybpod.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.1/) by the [Champalimaud Foundation](https://fchampalimaud.org/champalimaud-research/).
The PyBpod API is based on the _Bpod_ system's [MATLAB API](https://github.com/sanworks) by Josh Sanders of Sanworks.

This project is currently under development. More documentation will come soon.
