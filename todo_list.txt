Things to do:

    * __X__ use signals/slots instead of passing references to class objects.

    * __X__ close/stop streaming figure when stop button clicked

    * __X__ make gui stop other threads when experiment finished.

    * __X__ implement data recording with pytables

    * __X__ implement water valve buttons to only open for set duration

    * __X__ solve analog module giving error that Serial1_1 is invalid name

    * __X__ make results graph show percent of left licks instead of percent correct

    * __X__ have a counter that counts number of no responses and after certain number, it aborts experiment.

    * __X__ close serial devices and threads when application exits

    * __X__ get rid of the samplingThread and let the saveDataThread do the sampling and saving to .h5 and let it collect 100 or so samples in an array and emit it to the streamingWorker whenever it gets filled instead of one sample at a time.

    * __X__ save sniff signal (voltage over time) for each trial in .h5 file

    * __X__ save timestamps of lick events for each trial in .h5 file

    * __X__ synchronize analog data with state machine timing.

    * __X__ disable buttons that should not be clicked during certain operations

    * __X__ make a separate button to connect to devices first, before starting the experiment.

    * __X__ implement calibrate water valve buttons

    * __X__ implement progress bar dialog window for calibrating water

    * __X__ fix h5 file naming so that datetime format is YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS

    * __X__ configure tab order for the LineEdit fields

    * __X__ implement ability to configure protocol

    * __X__ implement ability to configure odors and/or olfa json file

    * __X__ make protocolWorker read from olfa config file before starting experiment to store odors/concentrations for stimulusRandomizer

    * __X__ in olfaEditorDialog, make sure that both odor name and concentration were given for a vial before saving the file
    
    * __X__ implement ability to configure flow rates

    * __X__ go back to the ITI state at the end of every trial so that the user can see more lick events instead of only one

    * __X__ implement ability to configure analog module

    * __X__ use SerialException instead of BpodErrorException for when connecting to the analog input module

    * __X__ allow user to run experiments without analog input (modify saveDataWorker to not save analog data, and do not plot a signal)

    * __X__ allow user to run experiments that do not use olfactometer

    * __X__ make the ITI user-adjustable.

    * __X__ implement progress bar for state machine during trial run

    * __X__ before aborting the experiment due to too many consecutive No Response results, create an optional feature that opens the water valves for a few milliseconds to attempt to re-motivate the mouse

    * __X__ make the No Response cutoff user-adjustable and allow it to be disabled.

    * __X__ implement pause button

    * __X__ make the streaming plotter run faster/smoother (maybe try pyqtgraph or blitting)

    * __X__ make the axis and scaling (and maybe speed) of the streaming plot adjustable

    * __X__ show the number of times each flow rate was used throughout the experiment, either with a plot or with QLineEdit fields.

    * __X__ make the protocolWorker check how many olfas are in the config file and use that number to randomize the parameters for each of the olfas and put them all in the stim dict.

    * __X__ shuffle a list of all the vials and then iterate through it instead of randomly choosing a vial every trial.

    * _____ use the newer olfactometer code

    * _____ have a timer (in the state machine) that aborts experiment when no sniff signal for certain amount of time

    * _____ implement serial port selection for each device with combobox that list available serial ports for user to pick

    * _____ implement validators for the line edits to restrict input values

    * _____ try using @pyqtSlot for a function to check if the thread will call it even if its running in an infinite loop.

    * _____ create a metadata for the .h5 file

    * _____ change the worker threads to use timers instead of infinite while loops

    * _____ fix issue of application crashing or does not do anything when start button is clicked again after experiment completion
            (seems to happen when user quickly presses start button after the experiment stops and error message says "QThread: Destroyed while thread is still running"
            so perhaps I need to ensure some time elapses before the user can start the experiment again so the threads have enough time to finish running and delete themselves,
            or I could check if any of the threads exist and are running at the time the user clicks the start button and if there is one then I could stop it and delete it)

    * _____ modify saveDataWorker to handle KeyErrors and TypeErrors for when different protocols are used or when olfactometer is not used.

    * _____ make a feature to manually choose what flow rate or what correct response will be for the next trial to de-bias

    * _____ get rid of variables that hold the value/text in fields like lineEdits, spinBoxes, and comboBoxes because it is redundant. 

    * _____ make an option to reconnect devices (close serial port and then open again) so that user can enable device that previously was not enabled when the 'Connect Devices' button was clicked without having to restart the application.

    * _____ fix the issue where the timestamps of the analog data samples stops being synchronized with the bpod's time whenever a trial is paused.

    * _____ make a slider that changes the probability of the shaping reward.

    * _____ make a feature for using probe trials with a slider that adjusts how often the probe trial is used.

    * _____ make sure the olfactometer sets dummy vial and all outputs of the bpod turn off when experiment finishes or an error occurs. 

    * _____ instead of randomly choosing the odor for two odor intensity experiment, make an option to always alternate between the two odors.

    * _____ make the streaming plot show the all the inputs and make another plot to show all the outputs.

    * _____ make the streaming plot able to plot more than one channel from the analog input.


Questions to research:

    * _____ How to connect signal from one thread to a slot in another thread that is running in an infinite loop without using lambda function?

    * _____ How to block execution within a thread for a certain amount of time?

    * _____ Why does infinite loop in separate thread (without some sort of sleep interval) cause main thread to freeze or lag?

    * _____ Why does infinite loop inside a separate thread block slots from being handled?

    * _____ When a signal is connected to multiple slots, does pyqt execute all of those slots simultaneously or sequentially?
